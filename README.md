<br/>
DCSFlightpanels primary use is for using Saitek/Logitech panels and Stream Deck in DCS World.
<br/>
Together with DCS-BIOS you can manage every control for the aircraft and use
the Radio Panel to operate cockpit radio equipment and also show data from the
aircraft in the Multipanel & Backlit Panel.
Using DCSFlightpanels as a key emulator it can be used in almost any game like
Elite Dangerous, War Thunder, Flaming Cliff Series, IL-2.
You can use multiple panels of each type and configure them separately.
DCSFlightpanels supports [Simple Radio Standalone](https://github.com/ciribob/DCS-SimpleRadioStandalone) (PZ69 Radio Panel).
