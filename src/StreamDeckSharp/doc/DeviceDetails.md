## Stream Deck Mini
No details atm.

## Stream Deck XL

### Button Auto-Press Issue
My (and according to a quick google search also some other customers) stream deck xl started to automatically
trigger random buttons and sometimes event kept some buttons pressed for quite a while.

It looks like the stream deck xl has a design issue where some buttons are randomly pressed.
For my device (and accoring to some other customer videos) the following buttons seem to be affected:

🔲🔲🔲❌🔲🔲🔲🔲
🔲🔲🔲❌🔲🔲❌❌
🔲🔲🔲❌🔲🔲🔲🔲
🔲🔲🔲❌🔲🔲🔲🔲
