# DCSFlightpanels

DCSFlightpanels primary use is for using Saitek/Logitech panels in DCS-WORLD.
Together with DCS-BIOS you can manage every control for the aircraft and use
the Radio Panel to operate cockpit radio equipment and also show data from the
aircraft in the Multipanel & Backlit Panel.
Using DCSFlightpanels as a key emulator it can be used in almost any game like
Elite Dangerous, War Thunder, Flaming Cliff Series, IL-2.
You can use multiple panels of each sort and have them configured separately.

-Using [FSF]Ian's DCS-BIOS, now possible to set landing gear lights based on data from DCS

v1.6 [6 January 2015]
-Now using Windows HID driver.
-Uses mikeobrien/HidLibrary (see more under About)
-Possible to click LEDs in interface to have them changed (GREEN/YELLOW/RED/DARK).
-Threaded key presses. If a long key press is reissued while first issued is still being pressed then first is cancelled and second pressed.

v1.5 [20 April 2014]
-Added longer options for key presses. Few bug fixes.

v1.4 [17 April 2014]
-Added option for choosing Windows API:s for keyboard emulation. Alternatives are keybd_event() and SendKeys().

v1.3 [25 Feb 2014]
-Added option for checking for Digital Combat Simulator before sending key commands. This enables using the program for other simulators.

v1.2(BETA) [12 Feb 2014]
-Added sequenced key presses. Now possible to add unlimited number of key press sequences. ***VERSION IS BETA***

v1.1 [4 Feb 2014]
-Added log information when Flightpanels can't find DCS windows -> thus won't send virtual key presses.
 "DCS window not found. No key press created."
 NO OTHER CHANGES -> not an important update
 
v1.0 [3 Feb 2014]
-Added all Virtual Keycodes to configuration file for easier manual editing.
-Added Disable button. Clicking this button activates "Disable Mode" (Red exclamation mark visible). During this mode
 no key presses will be sent forward to the operating system/DCS. This is useful when you have respawned in a new airframe and you need
 to reset all the switches so as to reflect the status of the various components in the new airframe.
-No key presses will be forwarded unless a valid windows handle is aquired to a window named "Digital Combat Simulator" or "DCS". This ensures that
 Flighpanels do not forward key presses to other applications (windows).
